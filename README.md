### Introduction

The **Interactive Question Management Sheet** is a single-page web application designed to help users organize and manage a hierarchical collection of questions grouped by topics and sub-topics.

The application enables users to dynamically create, edit, delete, and reorder topics, sub-topics, and individual questions through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. The primary goal is to provide a clean, responsive, and user-friendly experience for maintaining structured learning or assessment content.
